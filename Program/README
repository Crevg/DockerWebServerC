1)
The OS version that should be used to test it is Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

First you need to extract the project files and go to the directory where they are located,
then you can open a terminal inside the directory call "Program". Then run the script using the following command:

	sudo bash Installation.sh

This is will prompt you to accept please type Y and hit enter when asked to.
This installs the docker, the container and the server within it.

2) 
In order to uninstall and reinstall the server within the container the following commands are used: 

    sudo docker exec CONTAINER_NAME bash /usr/Server/uninstallServer.sh 

    sudo docker exec CONTAINER_NAME bash /usr/Server/installServer.sh 

Replacing CONTAINER_NAME with the correct name of the newly created container
3) 
In general in order to run any command such as systemtcl status WebServer.service the following structure is used:

    sudo docker exec CONTAINER_NAME bash COMMAND_TO_RUN

Replacing CONTAINER_NAME with the correct name of the newly created container and COMMAND_TO_RUN with the desired command
    
The server searches for files on the folder /usr/Server/Files/ 
The configuration file is located on /etc/webserver/config.conf within the container

4) 
To remove the container use the following command:
	sudo bash Uninstallation.sh

5)
In order to uninstall docker from the machine the following command is needed:
	sudo bash uninstallDocker.sh

6) to run the whole benchmark you can just run the command line:
    bash ./installBenchmarkTool.sh

*this temporaly will create a csv file for each test inside the benchmark tool

if you only want to install the bclient you just need to run the script like this:
    bash ./installBenchmarkTool.sh

And then you can run the command line with bclient following the next structure:
    bclient <machine> <port> <file> <N-threads> <N-cycles>

Example: bclient localhost 8001 html_basic_document.html 5 5 

7) 

In order to run successfully the threaded server with Pthreads library the following needs to be done:
In the source code ServerThread/src/daemon.c the #include needs to be changed to include the pthreads library and the very next line the typedef needs to be changed from mypthread_t to pthreads_t.
Then instead of installing using Installation.sh, the installation needs to be done using InstallationP.sh this is to ensure the correct flags being set during the compilation.
